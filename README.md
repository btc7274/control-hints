Creating and managing UI for showing game controls has always been one of those tedious tasks that plagued development. Everyone knows they should add it, but there's no easy way of going about it. Look no further, I have the definitive solution for you. **Control Hints** integrates seamlessly with Input Action System (IAS) to generate pretty control hints **complete with industry-standard icons for PC, Xbox, PlayStation, and Mobile.**

### ⭐️ Key Features
- **IAS Compatibility**: Works with the standard IAS setup (Context -> Action -> Binding)
- **All Platforms**: Keyboard/mouse, Xbox, PlayStation, and mobile devices
- **Customizable**: Choose from premade display styles and icon sets, or make your own
- **Safety First**: All code is written with strict typechecking
- **Optional Features**: Responsive icons, key combinations, and more

By default, the name of the InputAction is displayed, but this can be overridden by setting the CustomName attribute (string) for the InputAction. You can also set the CustomOrder attribute (number) can override auto-sort.
